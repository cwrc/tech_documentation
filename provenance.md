## CWRC releases:

### "Regular" releases:

Based on the amount of new or updated software sitting on the staging server, CWRC releases are scheduled at the discretion of the CWRC Project Leader, after consulting with the rest of the CWRC team (project manager, technical lead, developers).
The actual release is preceded by another round of testing on the staging server and is documented at https://github.com/cwrc/beta.cwrc.ca/releases.


### Hotfixes, security patches:

As time is of the essence for this type of software release, we are installing them on the CWRC platform as soon asthey become available.
